        I have just finished my C4T7 class and find out coding is very awesome. For about 2 months, I have made new friends who are very
        fiendly, talented and co-operative. I have learned the basic of Python, Html, CSS and Javascript which are so hard and fascinating.
        And my special thanks to Mr.Quang, Mr.Duc and Mr.Don, you have inspired me with programming, helped me to debug the code, taught me
        how to flirt a girl (disappointingly failed), etc. To sum up, I'd like to say it is lovely,wonderful to learn to code and meet new
        awesome people at Teckid.
